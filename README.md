PyCitySchools Analysis
Overview
Welcome to the PyCitySchools Analysis repository! Here, we utilize the power of Python and Pandas to perform in-depth analysis on district-wide standardized test results, aiming to uncover key trends and insights that will help our city's school board and mayor make informed decisions on school budgets and priorities.

Objective
The goal of this project is to aggregate the provided test scores and associated school data, then produce a series of summaries and breakdowns that will showcase trends in school performance.
